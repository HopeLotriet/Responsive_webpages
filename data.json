With its widing canals, striking architecture, and beautiful bridges. It has no roads, just canals. It is known as the 'Floating City' The population of Venice has decreased from 120 000 to 60 000 in the last 50 years. Some experts believe Venice could be a ghost town by 2030 with only tourists visiting by day."
